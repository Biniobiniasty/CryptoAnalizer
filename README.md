 <b>CryptoAnalizer</b> - Consists of two modules (Harvester and Analyzer)<br />
 The program downloads data from publicly available Internet sources and displays them in one place. It analyzes the collected data and displays various information.
 <br /><br />
Due to the differences in sources, each source is analyzed by an individual implementation. If the source code changes and the program doesn't read the information correctly, it will either take zero or discard the data it doesn't take into account.
